//! Exercise 15.28:
//! Define a vector to hold Quote objects but put Bulk_quote objects into that
//! vector. Compute the total net_price of all the elements in the vector.
//!
//! Exercise 15.29:
//! Repeat your program, but this time store shared_ptrs to objects of type
//! Quote. Explain any discrepancy in the sum generated by the this version and
//! the previous program.
//!
//  Since the vector from the previous exercise holds objects, there's no polymorphism
//  happened while calling the virtual function net_price. Essentially, the obejcts
//  held in it are the Quote subjects of the Bulk_quote objects being pushed back,
//  Thus, the virtual net_price functions called are Quote::net_price. As a result,
//  no discount was applied. The outcome was 9090
//
//  The obejcts held for this exercise are smart pointers to the Quote objects.In this
//  case, ppolymorphism happened as expected.The actual virtual functions being called
//  are Bulk_quote::net_price that ensure discount is applied.Thus, the outcome is 6363.
//  It can be found that 30% dicount has been applied to the price calculation.
//
//!
//! If there is no discrepancy, explain why there isn’t one.
