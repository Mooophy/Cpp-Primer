// Exercise 15.24:
// What kinds of classes need a virtual destructor? What operations must a
// virtual destructor perform?
//  Generally, a base class should define a virtual destructor.
//  The destructor needs to be virtual to allow objects in the inheritance
//  hierarchy to be dynamically allocated and destroyed.
//
// Exercise 15.25:
// Why did we define a default constructor for Disc_quote? What effect, if
// any, would removing that constructor have on the behavior of Bulk_quote?
//
//  Without it, when building the statement below, the compiler would complain
//  that:
//
// note: 'Bulk_quote::Bulk_quote()' is implicitly deleted because the default
// definition would be ill-formed.
//
//  The reason is that a constructor taking 4 parameters has been defined, which
//  prevented the compiler generate synthesized version default constructor. As a
//  result, the default constructor of any class derived from it has been defined
//  as deleted. Thus the default constructor must be defined explicitly so that
//  the derived classes can call it when executing its default constructor.
