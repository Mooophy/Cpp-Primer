## Exercise 4.1
>What is the value returned by 5 + 10 * 20/2?

105

## Exercise 4.2
>Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to
indicate the order in which the operands are grouped:
```cpp
* vec.begin() //=> *(vec.begin())
* vec.begin() + 1 //=> (*(vec.begin())) + 1
```

## Exercise 4.3
>Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left
undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization.
This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation
and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer.
Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

No. IMHO, such design cannot improve performance siginificantly, but it can make bugs very tricky to handle.

## Exercise 4.4
>Parenthesize the following expression to show how it is evaluated.
Test your answer by compiling the expression (without parentheses)
and printing its result.
```cpp
12 / 3 * 4 + 5 * 15 + 24 % 4 / 2
// parenthesize
((12/3)*4) + (5*15) + ((24%4)/2)
// 16 + 75 + 0 = 91
// print: 91
```

## Exercise 4.5
>Determine the result of the following expressions.
```cpp
-30 * 3 + 21 / 5  // -90+4 = -86
-30 + 3 * 21 / 5  // -30+63/5 = -30+12 = -18
30 / 3 * 21 % 5   // 10*21%5 = 210%5 = 0
-30 / 3 * 21 % 4  // -10*21%4 = -210%4 = -2
```

## Exercise 4.6
>Write an expression to determine whether an int value is even or odd.

```cpp
 i & 0x1 
```

## Exercise 4.7
>What does overflow mean? Show three expressions that will overflow.

from the book:
>Some arithmetic expressions yield undefined results. Some of these undefined espressions are due to the nature of mathematics-for example, division by zero. Others are undefined due to the nature of computers-for example, due to overflow. Overflow happens when a value is computed that is outside the range of values that the type can represent.

```cpp
short svalue = 32767; ++svalue; // -32768
unsigned uivalue = 0; --uivalue;  // 4294967295
unsigned short usvalue = 65535; ++usvalue;  // 0
```

## Exercise 4.8
>Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical `AND`, logical `OR`, and equality operators.

from the book:
> The logical `AND` and `OR` operators always evaluate their left operand before the right. Moreover, the right operand is evaluated if and only if the left operand does not determine the result. This strategy is known as **short-circuit evaluation**.

- logical `AND` : the second operand is evaluated if and only if the left side is `true`.
- logical `OR`  : the second operand is evaluated if and only if the left side is `false`
- equality operators `==` : undefined.

## Exercise 4.9
>Explain the behavior of the condition in the following if:
```cpp
const char *cp = "Hello World";
if (cp && *cp)
```

cp is a pointer to `const char *`, and it's not a nullptr. true.

`*cp` is a const char: 'H', and it is explicit a nonzero value. true.

true && true -> true.

## Exercise 4.10
>Write the condition for a while loop that would read ints from
the standard input and stop when the value read is equal to 42.

```cpp
int i = 0;
while(cin >> i && i != 42)
```

## Exercise 4.11
>Write an expression that tests four values, a, b, c, and d,
and ensures that a is greater than b, which is greater than c,
which is greater than d.

```cpp
a>b && b>c && c>d
```

## Exercise 4.12
>Assuming `i`, `j`, and `k` are all ints, explain what `i != j < k` means.

`i != j < k` is equivalent to `i != (j < k)`.


## Exercise 4.13
>What are the values of i and d after each assignment?
```cpp
int i;   double d;
d = i = 3.5; // i = 3, d = 3.0
i = d = 3.5; // d = 3.5, i = 3
```

## Exercise 4.14
>Explain what happens in each of the if tests:
```cpp
if (42 = i)   // complie error: expression is not assignable
if (i = 42)   // true.
```

## Exercise 4.15
>The following assignment is illegal. Why? How would you correct it?
```cpp
double dval; int ival; int *pi;
dval = ival = pi = 0;
// pi is a pointer to int.
// can not assign to 'int' from type 'int *'
// correct it:
dval = ival = 0;
pi = 0;
```

## Exercise 4.16
>Although the following are legal,
they probably do not behave as the programmer expects. Why?
Rewrite the expressions as you think they should be.
```cpp
if (p = getPtr() != 0)
if (i = 1024)
// why? always true. use an assigment as a condition.
// correct it
if ((p=getPtr()) != 0)
if (i == 1024)
```

## Exercise 4.17
>Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment.

See: [What is the difference between ++i and i++](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24853/what-is-the-difference-between-i-and-i)

## Exercise 4.18
>What would happen if the while loop on page 148 that prints
the elements from a vector used the prefix increment operator?

It will print from the second element and dereference `v.end()` at last, which is a **UB**.

## Exercise 4.19
>Given that ptr points to an int, that vec is a vector<int>,
and that ival is an int, explain the behavior of each of these expressions.
Which, if any, are likely to be incorrect? Why? How might each be corrected?

```cpp
ptr != 0 && *ptr++  // check ptr is not a nullptr, and then check the pointer value.
ival++ && ival // check ival, and then check ival+1 whether equal zero.
vec[ival++] <= vec[ival] // incorrect. It is an **undefined behavior.**
// correct:
vec[ival] <= vec[ival+1]
```

See [order of evaluation](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order).

## Exercise 4.20
>Assuming that iter is a vector<string>::iterator,
indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal.
Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and
why those that aren’t legal are in error.
```cpp
*iter++;  // return *iter, then ++iter.
(*iter)++;  // illegal, *iter is a string, cannot increment value.
*iter.empty() // illegal, iter should use '->' to indicate whether empty.
iter->empty();  // indicate the iter' value whether empty.
++*iter;        // illegal, string have not increment.
iter++->empty();  // return iter->empty(), then ++iter.
```

## [Exercise 4.21](ex4_21.cpp)
## [Exercise 4.22](ex4_22.cpp)
## Exercise 4.23
>The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence.
Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), explain why it fails. How would you fix it?
```cpp
string s = "word";
string pl = s + s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s" ;
```

Operator Precedence: `?:` < `+`
Fix it:
```cpp
string pl = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s") ;
```

## Exercise 4.24
>Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass,
and fail depended on the fact that
the conditional operator is right associative.
Describe how that operator would be evaluated
if the operator were left associative.

if the operator were left associative.
```cpp
finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";
```
would same as :
```cpp
finalgrade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)) ? "fail" : "pass";
```
if `grade > 90`, first conditional operator's result is `high pass`. so the finalgrade is always fail.
It's contradictory obviously.

## Exercise 4.25
>What is the value of ~'q' << 6 on a machine with 32-bit ints and 8 bit chars, that uses Latin-1 character set in which 'q' has the bit pattern 01110001?

The final value in decimal is `-7296`.  

## Exercise 4.26
>In our grading example in this section, what would happen if we used unsigned int as the type for quiz1?

The C++ standard does not specify the size of integral types in bytes, but it specifies minimum ranges they must be able to hold. The minimum range of `unsigned int` is 0 to 65535. Since some implementations use only the minimum 16 bits for `unsigned int`, this could cause undefined behavior.


## Exercise 4.27
>What is the result of each of these expressions?
```cpp
unsigned long ul1 = 3, ul2 = 7;
ul1 & ul2 // == 3
ul1 | ul2 // == 7
ul1 && ul2 // == true
ul1 || ul2 // == true
```

## [Exercise 4.28](ex4_28.cpp)
## Exercise 4.29
>Predict the output of the following code and explain your reasoning. Now run the program. Is the output what you expected? If not, figure out why.
```cpp
int x[10];   int *p = x;
cout << sizeof(x)/sizeof(*x) << endl;
cout << sizeof(p)/sizeof(*p) << endl;
```

 * The first is 10. It returns the number of elements in x. 
 * The second result is undefined.

## Exercise 4.30
>Using Table 4.12 (p. 166), parenthesize the following expressions to match the default evaluation:
```cpp
sizeof x + y      // (sizeof x)+y . "sizeof" has higher precedence than binary `+`.
sizeof p->mem[i]  // sizeof(p->mem[i])
sizeof a < b      // sizeof(a) < b
sizeof f()        //If `f()` returns `void`, this statement is undefined, otherwise it returns the size of return type.
```

## Exercise 4.31
>The program in this section used the prefix increment and decrement operators. Explain why we used prefix and not postfix. What changes would have to be made to use the postfix versions? Rewrite the program using postfix operators.

~~postfix will copy itself as return, then increment or decrement. prefix will increment or decrement first, and return itself. so prefix is more effective in this program.(reduce one copy space.)~~

We use prefix and not postfix, just because of the `Advice: Use Postfix Operators only When Necessary` on `§4.5. Increment and Decrement Operators`.

>**Advice: Use Postfix Operators only When Necessary**

>Readers from a C background might be surprised that we use the prefix increment in the programs we've written. The reason is simple: The prefix version avoids unnecessary work. It increments the value and returns the incremented version.The postfix operator must store the original value so that it can return the unincremented value as its result. If we don’t need the unincremented value, there’s no need for the extra work done by the postfix operator.

>For ints and pointers, the compiler can optimize away this extra work. For more complicated iterator types, this extra work potentially might be more costly. By habitually using the prefix versions, we do not have to worry about whether the performance difference matters. Moreover—and perhaps more importantly—we can express the intent of our programs more directly.

So, it's just a good habits. And there are no changes if we have to be made to use the postfix versions. Rewrite:
```cpp
for(vector<int>::size_type ix = 0; ix != ivec.size(); ix++, cnt--)  
    ivec[ix] = cnt;
```

This is not an appropriate example to discuss the difference of prefix and postfix. Look at the section `Built-in comma operator` on [this page](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operator_other).

reference: [Usage of the Built-in Comma Operator](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22591387/usage-of-the-built-in-comma-operator)

## Exercise 4.32
>Explain the following loop.
```cpp
constexpr int size = 5;
int ia[size] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
for (int *ptr = ia, ix = 0;
    ix != size && ptr != ia+size;
    ++ix, ++ptr) { /* ... */ }
```

`ptr` and `ix` have the same function. The former use a pointer, and the latter use the index of array. we use the loop to through the array.(just choose one from `ptr` and `ix`)

## Exercise 4.33
>Using Table 4.12 (p. 166) explain what the following expression does:
```cpp
someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x, --y
```

Because of the most lowest precedence of the comma operator, the expression is same as:
```cpp
(someValue ? ++x, ++y : --x), --y
```
If someValue is true, then `++x`, and the result is `y`, if someValue is false, then `--x`, and the result is `--y`. so it is also same as:
```cpp
someValue ? (++x, y) : (--x, --y);
```
Even though the result has nothing to do with `x`, the evaluation of `someValue` does effect the operation on `x`.

## Exercise 4.34
>Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what conversions take place in the following expressions:
(a) if (fval)
(b) dval = fval + ival;
(c) dval + ival * cval;
Remember that you may need to consider the associativity of the operators.

```cpp
if (fval) // fval converted to bool
dval = fval + ival; // ival converted to fval, then the result of fval add ival converted to double.
dval + ival * cval; // cval converted to int, then that int and ival converted to double.
```

## Exercise 4.35
>Given the following definitions,
```cpp
char cval; int ival; unsigned int ui; float fval; double dval;
```
identify the implicit type conversions, if any, taking place:
```cpp
cval = 'a' + 3; // 'a' promoted to int, then the result of ('a' + 3)(int) converted to char.
fval = ui - ival * 1.0; // ival converted to double , ui also converted to double. then that double converted(by truncation) to float.
dval = ui * fval; // ui promoted to float. then that float converted to double.
cval = ival + fval + dval;  // ival converted to float, then that float and fval converted to double. At last, that double converted to char(by truncation).
```

## Exercise 4.36
>Assuming i is an int and d is a double write the expression i *= d so that it does integral, rather than floating-point, multiplication.

```cpp
i *= static_cast<int>(d);
```

## Exercise 4.37
>Rewrite each of the following old-style casts to use a named cast:
```cpp
int i; double d; const string *ps; char *pc; void *pv;
pv = (void*)ps; // pv = const_cast<string*>(ps); or pv = static_cast<void*>(const_cast<string*>(ps));
i = int(*pc);   // i = static_cast<int>(*pc);
pv = &d;        // pv = static_cast<void*>(&d);
pc = (char*)pv; // pc = static_cast<char*>(pv);
```

## Exercise 4.38
>Explain the following expression:
```cpp
double slope = static_cast<double>(j/i);
```

j/i is an int(by truncation), then converted to double and assigned to slope.
