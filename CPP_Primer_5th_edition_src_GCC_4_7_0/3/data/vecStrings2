When we subscript a string, we get back a character.
When we subscript a vector, we get an object of whatever type the vector contains.
We can use the resulting (unnamed) object in exactly the same way we can use any other object of that type.
In particular, if the type is a class type, such as a library string, we can call member functions or use operators defined by the element type.

As an example, let's write a program to capitalize the first word of every sentence in the first paragraph of some text.
We'll assume that our input contains a series of lines.
Each line is either a complete sentence or it contains only a newline.
Lines containing a only a newline separate paragraphs.
