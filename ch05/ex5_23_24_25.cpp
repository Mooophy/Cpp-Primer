//!@Alan
//!
//! Exercise 5.23:
//! Write a program that reads two integers from the standard
//! input and prints the result of dividing the first number
//! by the second.
//!
//! Exercise 5.24:
//! Revise your program to throw an exception if the second
//! number is zero. Test your program with a zero input to see
//! what happens on your system if you donâ€™t catch an exception.
//!
//  Without exception catching, the programme was terminated when
//  a zero was entered.
//!
//! Exercise 5.25:
//! Revise your program from the previous exercise to use a try
//! block to catch the exception. The catch clause should print
//! a message to the user and ask them to supply a new number and
//! repeat the code inside the try.
//!
